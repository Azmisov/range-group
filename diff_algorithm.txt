- First want to find an intersection. While either a/b's end is below the other's start,
	we skip to its next range. We could use binary search here.
- For intersections, there are three parts: disjoint at start, intersection middle, and
	disjoint at end. The disjoint at the end could have another intersection elsewhere;
	since ranges are normalized, it is guaranteed the disjoint is the min range.
- Once we've resolved ranges from one of a/b, we end, possibly adding/removing all
	remaining elements.

Ideally we can handle both in-place and copy versions of the same method. Assuming we do
in-place modification of a, then probably only a/ab+a/ab are efficient operations, with
ab+b/b possibly requiring lots of copying of b. I think we can implement copy as an
extra copy whenever we have an in-place value from a, and then do the in-place operation
on the copy.

We have lists of a/b ranges and want to get the difference between the two. There are three diff
types: a+!b ("disjoint a"), a+b (intersection), and !a+b ("disjoint b")

a/b fully disjoint:
	in-place: insert if b
	copy: copy and push to array

ab intersect:

How we handle this depends on what we're filtering, and what parts of the intersection match that
filter. It also depends on if we are merging contiguous ab+a/ab+b/ab+a+b ranges. I will label the
intersection parts x|y|z, for disjoint start, middle intersection, and disjoint end respectively. We
may be filtering any of those parts which I'll indicate with hyphen, or by [x/y/z]_f (e.g. these
parts are not to be included).

All cases:
Note when we have z_f, we still need to keep it (or at least some info about it) in case of intersection later.
	a/b/-|ab|a/b
	x	 If b (and not a disjoint extension) or filtered a at start, a.start = b.start. We
			could also delete a and replace with b, but then we run into a
			possible problem with b as the disjoint end (see below). So seems
			maybe simpler to modify a's start and keep b separate.

	x	If disjoint a at end, we continue as normal

		If disjoint b at end, could intersect with further ranges. The next
		cases will be either:
			1) b: a.end extended to b.end
			2) b|ab|a: a.end extended to next a.end
			3) b|ab|b: can extend a.end, but reduces to same case again, so could just skip that a and repeat
		The other case we might want to handle like this is -|ab|b. Cases would
		be the same there except for #2
			2) b|ab|-: a.end extended to b.end (reduces to #1 case)
		
		>>> So we could extend a.end = b.end,
		but we'd have to have some self_union logic embedded to merge with 1+ subsequent a's. That
		would work for this case, but not play nicely if, e.g. we have -|ab|b case. I'm thinking
		we can have a flag union_with_previous, which is reset on next iter if no intersection; if
		not reset and we get an intersection, we
	a|ab|-b
	x	 copy b and set b.start = a.end (actually needed tough, since not keeping b?)
	b|ab|-a
	x	a.start = b.start
	x	copy a and set a.start = b.end (needed?); this is the disjoint a
	x	a.end = b.end
	-|ab|-a/b
	x	start a: a.start = b.start
	x	end a: copy a and set start = b.end (think we could just keep a.end though?); intersect a.end = b.end
	x	end b: copy and set start = a.end
	a/b|-|a/b
	x	start+end a: copy a, trim end and insert before;
	x	start+end b: copy/trim b.end;
			replace a
	x	start a + end b: trim a.end
	x	start b + end a: copy/trim b.end; insert before
	x	trim disjoint end's start
	-|-|a/b
	x	a: trim a.start
		b: remove a;
	x		copy and trim b.start
	a|-|-b
	x	a.end = b.start
	x	could update b.start, but wouldn't get used
	b|-|-a
	x	copy b, set b.end = a.start; insert
	x	set a.start = b.end

Summarized rules:
	- increment a/b, whichever != z
	- z is always the new minimum for next iteration
		need to make copy of z if z = b;
		update z.start if z_f || (z = a and y); set to exclusive y.end (will be opposites a/b)
		(z_f since its start will never be referenced; could instead exclude start from copy op)
	- copying a:
		When merging, there will only ever be one copy made, with the copy only necessary
		when a = z; so we make z be the copy;
		These three cases:
			a|-|-a
			*|ab|-a
			a|-|a
		possible logic: should_copy = a == z && (z_f ? a == x || y : a == x && y_f)
		Essentially, whenever there is a gap between two a's, where filtering z create a virtual gap
	- when to update a (in-place):
		the non-copy is a combination of disjoint start/intersection
			b/-|ab|* > a/y.start = b.start
			a|-|* = a/x.end = b.start
			b|ab|-a = a/y.end = b.end
	- insert b:
		when b = x and y_f; set copy b.end = a.start
	- remove a:
		when y_f and z != a (previously z = b) and x != a
	- extend b:
		when y and z = b, we get the case where b needs to extend a, but also stick around to check
		for intersections of subsequent a's. We're essentially doing an inline self_union on ranges
		of a. A couple ways to do that:
		- set "extending" flag; in next iter(s) if no intersection, old_a.end = b.end; if intersection,
			(if b = z, delete a and continue; else a = z, set old_a.end = a.end and delete a; else
			z empty, old_a.end = b/a.end, and delete a)
		- alternatively inline self_union loop: loop and find first a.end >= b.end,
			if a.start > b.start, old_a.end = b.end; delete all a's exclusive
			else, old_a.end = a.end; delete all a's inclusive

	Perform ops in this order:
	- insert b
	- remove a, or copy + update a
	- update z
	- increment a/b

What about when x/z are empty, how do the rules change?
	empty z:
		- increment both a/b, with no known minimum for next iter; automatically handled with:
			if (a != z) a.inc();
			if (b != z) b.inc();
		- will never copy a; automatically handled with example logic
		- no need to update a/y.end
		- remove a e.g. change rule to be z != a
	empty x:
		- don't copy a if filtering y; automatically handled with example logic
		- no need to update a/y.start (or a/x.end, since x is empty)
		- will never insert another b (besides at end)
		- remove a automatically handled by x != a logic

What if not merging?
	All the cases with y_f need no special handling, since they aren't getting merged anyways. I'm
	thinking we could virtually treat it like a y_f case, and then inject y in afterwards.

What if copying?
	Whenever a is being modified in-place, we instead copy it first and then do the in-place
	modification on the copy. Remove a ops are ignored


I'm thinking we could efficiently implement the case logic using three bitsets: which of x|y|z
is filtered, a, and b. The absence of either a/b flag can indicate empty x/z; y for a/b will always
be set, so maybe can exclude that unless it makes masking with `filtered` easier to keep it.

So I started implementing this, and I ran into a little sticky spot. We have all these rules about
when to copy A, and then how to update A. And it seemed complicated to have to track which position
the preserved A was in (since it can be in one of x/y/z), and update accordingly. I added small
logic to track that. With that logic, it actually seemed quite simple to add logic to handle each
segment (x/y/z) case separately, and just "rebuild" the section completely without trying to reuse
A. I sort of suspected that could be the case at the very beginning... that rebuilding might just
end up being easier than trying to reuse the existing A. Implementing the logic for rebuilding
was quite simple, and turns out it very naturally handles merging; e.g. the same logic we use
to extend z to the next iteration can be used, with some modification, to extend from one segment
to the next. Given the cleanliness of that solution, I think I'll just leave it at that, and
then try and see if we can add a couple special cases for preserving the existing A if it wouldn't
change. E.g. the following cases:
	merging && a/empty/-b|ab|a/empty/-b
		e.g. can't have b/-a on sides
	!merging && b/-b/empty|ab|b/-b/empty (here may still need to inject start/end b copies)
		e.g. can't have a/-a on sides; also can't be b if don't want to inject b copies
So conditions we could detect:
	- ab not filtered in middle
	- no filtered a on sides
	- no unfiltered a/b on sides, which is merging dependent
